# Plex Lazy TV

You have a tremendous number of shows in your library and can't decide what episode to watch next?
I got you!
The Plex Lazy TV script is a script that will generate and maintain for you a smart playlist shuffled in the right way so as you can watch the next unwatched episode of a show.

## How does it work?

Say that you are watching Friends and you are at episode: S01E06 and in the same time you are watching The Office and you are at S03E04 and of course, in the same time you are at S04E04 of Samurai Jack. This script will shuffle your watched shows and create a random playlist but in the right order. Something like this:

- Samurai Jack S04E04
- Samurai Jack S04E05
- The Office S03E06
- Friends S03E04
- Samurai Jack S04E06
- The Office S03E07

Each time you mark something from the playlist as watched, the script will take it out and replace it with the next unwatched episode of your watched shows. It's like watching TV but you always get the next unwatched episode, not a random one from the end of the season or a something that you already watched.
